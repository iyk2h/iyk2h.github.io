Q 3,4

### 빈출 유형

쇼핑, 사무실, 식당, 거리, 물가, 실내, 실외



### 채점 포인트

- 적합한 어휘
	- 표현(외적 표현보다 동작 표현(동사(stand, sit, hold))이 점수가 더 높다.)
- 올바른 문법
	- 현재 진행형 be Ving, 전치사(in, on, at)

- 내용의 일관성
- 정확한 발음



### 고득점 전략

- 인물 : 위치 > 외모 > 동작, 사물 : 위치 > 상태 및 개수
- 인물 수 / 구도에 따른 묘사 순서 정하기
- 묘사 대사의 위치 반드시 말하기
- 비동사 주의, 문법 사항에 주의, 같은 동사 반복 피하기
- 쉬운 동사를 활용하여 동작 위주 묘사
- something / someone 적절히 활용
- 답변 시간 45초 꽉 채워서 묘사
- 마무리는 가볍게
- 총 9문장 정도가 좋다.



### 준비 순서

인물 : 위치 > 외모 > 동작, 사물 : 위치 > 상태 및 개수

- 도입부
	- 장소, 등장 인원 수,
- 대상묘사
	- 인물 먼저, 주변 사물, 배경 묘사
	- 시간이 부족하면 인물 묘사만 완벽하게
- 마무리
